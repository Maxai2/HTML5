                Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free. You can use Telegram on
                all your devices
                <strong>at the same time</strong>
                — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and
                <a href="#">
                    <strong>files</strong>
                </a> of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to
                <strong>100,000</strong> people or
                <a href="#">channels</a> for broadcasting to
                <strong>unlimited</strong>
                audiences. You can write to your phone contacts and find people by their
                <a href="#">
                    <strong>usernames</strong>
                </a>. As a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business
                messaging needs. In addition to this, we support
                <a href="#">end-to-end encrypted voice calls</a>.
            </p>

            <h4>

            </h4>
            <p>
                Telegram is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and
                <a href="#">calls</a> . Business users and small teams may like the large groups,
                <a href="#">usernames</a>,
                <a href="#">desktop apps</a> and powerful
                <a href="#">file sharing</a> options.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Telegram groups can have up to
                <a href="#">100,000 members</a>
                , we support
                <a href="#">replies, mentions and hashtags</a> that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities
                <a href="#">efficient</a>
                . You can appoint
                <a href="#">admins with advanced tools</a> to help these communities prosper in peace.
                <a href="#">Public groups</a> can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                In case you're more into pictures, Telegram has animated
                <a href="#">gif search</a> , a state of the art
                <a href="#">photo editor</a> , and an
                <a href="#">open sticker platform</a> (find some cool stickers
                <a href="#">here</a> or
                <a href="#">here</a> ). What‘s more, there is no need to worry about disk space on your device. With Telegram’s cloud
                support and
                <a href="#">cache management options</a>, Telegram can take up nearly
                <strong>zero</strong> space on your phone.

                Q: How is Telegram different from WhatsApp?
            </h4>

            <p>
                Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync. As a result, you can access your messages from several
                devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files
                (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 1,5 GB
                <i>each</i>. And if you don't want to store all that data on your device, you can always
                <a href="#">keep it in the cloud</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to our multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, Telegram is faster and way more
                <a href="#">secure</a>. On top of that, Telegram is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our API is open, and we welcome developers to create their own Telegram apps. We also have a
                <a href="#">Bot API</a>, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for Telegram,
                <a href="#">integrate any services</a>, and even
                <a href="#">accept payments</a> from users around the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                Telegram is supported by Pavel and Nikolai Durov. Pavel supports Telegram financially and ideologically while Nikolai's input
                is technological. To make Telegram possible, Nikolai developed a unique custom data protocol, which is open,
                secure and optimized for work with multiple data-centers. As a result, Telegram combines security, reliability
                and speed on any network.

                The Telegram development team is based in Dubai.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the developers behind Telegram originally come from
                <a href="#">St. Petersburg</a>, the city famous for its unprecedented number of
                <a href="#">highly skilled engineers</a>. The Telegram team had to leave Russia due to local IT regulations and has tried
                a number of locations as its base, including Berlin, London and Singapore. We’re currently happy with Dubai,
                although are ready to relocate again if local regulations change.

            <p>
                <a href="#">Pavel Durov</a>, who shares our vision, supplied Telegram with a generous donation, so we have quite enough
                money for the time being. If Telegram runs out, we will introduce non-essential paid options to support the
                infrastructure and finance developer salaries. But making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram.

                Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Big internet companies like Facebook or Google have effectively hijacked the privacy discourse in the recent years. Their
                marketers managed to convince the public that the most important things about privacy are superficial tools
                that allow hiding your public posts or your profile pictures from the people around you. Adding these superficial
                tools enables companies to calm down the public and change nothing in how they are turning over private data
                to marketers and other third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Telegram we think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be instead:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.</li>
                <li>Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This is what everybody should care about, and these are some of our top priorities. Telegram's aim is to create a truly free
                messenger,
                <a href="#">without the usual caveats</a>. This means that instead of diverting public attention with low-impact settings,
                we can afford to focus on the real privacy issues that exist in the modern world.

                Q: What about GDPR?
            </h4>
            <p>
                New regulations regarding data privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in Europe on
                May 25, 2018. Since taking back our right to privacy was the reason we made Telegram, there wasn‘t much we
                had to change. We don’t use your data for ad targeting, we don’t sell it to others, and we’re not part of
                any
                <del>mafia family</del> “family of companies.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Telegram only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich cloud service — for example, your cloud chats
                so that you can access them from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts so that
                you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on Telegram. Please see our

            <p>
                Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet. To do this in the places where
                it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have
                to process legitimate requests to take down illegal
                <strong>public</strong> content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app. For example, we can take
                down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.
            </p>
            <p>
                User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI. Whenever
                we receive a complaint at
                <a href="#">abuse@telegram.org</a> or
                <a href="#">dmca@telegram.org</a> regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and
                take it down when deemed appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that this does
                <strong>not</strong> apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech. For example, if criticizing the government
                is illegal in some country, Telegram won‘t be a part of such politically motivated censorship. This goes
                against our founders’
                <a href="#">principles</a>. While we do block terrorist (e.g. ISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody
                who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.

            </p>
            <p>
                To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure. Cloud chat
                data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities
                spread across different jurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept
                in the same place as the data they protect. As a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions
                are required to force us to give up any data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's
                privacy and freedom of expression. Telegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal
                enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.
